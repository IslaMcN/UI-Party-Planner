# UI-Party-Planner

Pitch: App to keep track of all your party planning details!
MVP:Ability to add a new party. New party fields include number of guests, theme, date, budget. You can then add pictures to your party mood board, plan the entertainment, create a shopping list with the ability to mark individual items as purchased, and create a general to do list. Marking an item as purchased pops up with a modal to enter the price. Hitting submit updates the budget with amount left. Completed items will also be formatted like this on the shopping or to do list. Ability to add new categories to track

Stretch: Add the ability to connect with your facebook account to add party attendees by your list of friends and send a facebook invite.
